# Sponsor Logo Slots

Drop your real sponsor logos in this folder with exactly these names:

- `sponsor-01.webp`
- `sponsor-02.webp`
- `sponsor-03.webp`
- `sponsor-04.webp`

The website automatically uses these files in the "Sponsoren" section on `index.html`.

## Required format

- File format: `WEBP`
- Recommended background: transparent or white
- Recommended width: 800px to 1600px
- Recommended max file size: <= 300 KB per logo

If a file is missing, the slot shows the expected filename as placeholder.
